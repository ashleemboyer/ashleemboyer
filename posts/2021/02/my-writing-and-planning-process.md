When I first started seriously writing in early 2019, it was because I committed to a 30-day blogging challenge. My main goal of this challenge was to see if I even liked blogging and sharing my ideas so publicly. I'm still here and telling you about my process, so hopefully it's clear that I like it!

What I discovered is that publishing a post a day wasn't sustainable for me. I think it takes a special kind of person and a special kind of content to publish daily and I applaud anyone who does that. I personally can't keep up with a schedule like that because I have chronic issues that make my spoon levels unreliable. As I write this, I'm pretty low on spoons but I've been looking forward to this post for several weeks, so that's what's motivating me. :)
