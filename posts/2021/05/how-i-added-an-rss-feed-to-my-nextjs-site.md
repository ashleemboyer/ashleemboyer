I recently came across [a tweet from Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1390598514774847496) applauding folks who provide an RSS feed on their site. Sara is someone I highly admire in frontend web development and accessibility, but I had so little knowledge of RSS feeds and so many questions:

- What the heck are they?
- What are they for?
- I thought people didn't use them anymore?

If you also have questions like this, I recommend reading [How Do RSS Feeds Work?](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) right from RSS.com. The first few words really sum it up:

> Imagine being able to log into one dashboard and getting the latest news and events from all of your favorite websites, blogs, or podcasts? With RSS feeds, itâ€™s possible!

To better understand how RSS feeds are consumed, I created my own RSS reader app and I also [wrote about it](https://ashleemboyer.com/create-your-own-nextjs-rss-reader-app) so you can create one too if you like. The app I created also served as a great way for me to test my RSS feed as I built it!

## How I Added an RSS Feed to my Next.js Site

There were two main problems I ran into while trying to build an RSS feed for my articles. Firstly, I didn't know that neither the `<description>` nor `content` of each `<item>` in the channel can't have regular HTML in it. [The HTML tags must be encoded](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/encodingDescriptions.html). Secondly, I found out it's really difficult to try to parse the HTML content in a Node.js environment on my own before putting it into the feed.

After struggling for hours and trying several different approaches, I [went to Twitter for help](https://twitter.com/AshleeMBoyer/status/1391568723581054978). There were a lot of helpful replies! I found exactly what I ended up using thanks to [an example project](https://github.com/sweeneyapps/html2rssfeed) from [@vphreak](https://twitter.com/vphreak/status/1391853784666501121). So, what did it take?

First, I installed [the `feed` package](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed).

```bash
yarn add feed
```

Then, I added a `generateRSSFeed` function.

```js
const generateRSSFeed = (articles) => {
  const baseUrl = 'https://ashleemboyer.com';
  const author = {
    name: 'Ashlee Boyer',
    email: 'hello@ashleemboyer.com',
    link: 'https://twitter.com/ashleemboyer',
  };

  // Construct a new Feed object
  const feed = new Feed({
    title: 'Articles by Ashlee M Boyer',
    description:
      "You can find me talking about issues surrounding Disability, Accessibility, and Mental Health on Twitter, or you can find me regularly live-knitting or live-coding on Twitch. I'm @AshleeMBoyer on all the platforms I use.",
    id: baseUrl,
    link: baseUrl,
    language: 'en',
    feedLinks: {
      rss2: `${baseUrl}/rss.xml`,
    },
    author,
  });

  // Add each article to the feed
  articles.forEach((post) => {
    const {
      content,
      fileName,
      meta: { date, description, title },
    } = post;
    const url = `${baseUrl}/${fileName}`;

    feed.addItem({
      title,
      id: url,
      link: url,
      description,
      content,
      author: [author],
      date: new Date(date),
    });
  });

  // Write the RSS output to a public file, making it
  // accessible at ashleemboyer.com/rss.xml
  fs.writeFileSync('public/rss.xml', feed.rss2());
};
```

Finally, I updated the `getStaticProps` function exported from `src/pages/index.jsx` to call the new `generateRSSFeed` function.

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const articles = getAllArticles();
  articles.sort((a, b) => (a.meta.date < b.meta.date ? 1 : -1)

  generateRSSFeed(articles);

  return { props: { articles } };
}
```

Because my site is set up to build only when my main git branch is updated, `getStaticProps` will be called at that time and so will `generateRSSFeed`. This means the feed is always up to date when I push a new Markdown file for each post or whenever existing files are updated.
