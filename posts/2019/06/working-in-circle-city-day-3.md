# The morning

I can't help but find myself fascinated by everything here. While I'm doing my 10-minute walk from my car to the office, I wonder about the stories other people on the street might have to tell. Where do they work? Do they have kids? How long have they been doing this? People watching is quickly becoming such a fun thing to do when I'm out and about the city streets.

# The afternoon

We were still having some issues with my set up in the system, so we decided it was time to take a lunch. 😅 I tried another new place: Potbelly Sandwich Shop!

It 👏🏻 was 👏🏻 amazing 👏🏻

I also met the CEO! He walked up to me right after I had picked up my lunch sandwich, so we fist-bumped instead of shaking hands. 🤣 After lunch, I was expecting to go into a meeting, but it was rescheduled so the team and I continued to look at my setup so I could get coding. We figured it out, and the team lead walked me through my first ticket! I learned about so many things, and am taking note of them to eventually do some further reading:

# The evening

Tonight I went to the first event of an author series at The Vogue Nightclub in Broad Ripple. Max Yoder, CEO of Lessonly, talked about his book, _Do Better Work_, answered a few questions, and played a few of his songs for us. It was a really great time!

I paid extra for a guaranteed floor seat and that ticket also came with the book. It's going to be a good one, especially after hearing Max give an overview of each chapter. What he had to say and how he said it as a CEO was incredibly refreshing. You can 100% tell how passionate he is about making the world a better place.

I also feel so validated. It’s overwhelming. And while I’m still not sure about the most productive way to talk about the past year, I know I _have_ to and that it’s part of my story I want to share. I want people to know that they don’t have to roll over and take bad treatment from people in leadership positions just because they sign your paychecks.

You can get out of bad situations (and you _should_). You are not trapped forever. Ask someone you trust for help. Put yourself out there. You _will_ get out. You _will_ find where you're celebrated, not just tolerated.

If you ever need someone to talk to, please talk to me. I was there just a couple of months ago. I might not have answers for you, but I'm here to listen at the very least.
