My new job is downtown Indianapolis. Today was my first day for a whole list of things!

<ul style="list-style: none;margin-left: 0;">
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">🚗</span>Parked in a parking garage all day</li>
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">🚶🏼‍♀️</span>Walked 5 minutes to work</li>
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">🍳</span>Had breakfast by myself downtown</li>
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">🛍</span>Shopped in two stores by myself downtown</li>
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">🍕</span>Had lunch at Giordano’s</li>
  <li><span style="margin-right: 12px">💻</span>Thoroughly used a MacBook Pro</li>
</ul>

I’m sure there’ll be lots of firsts in the coming months. I finally feel like I’m in an environment and community where I can grow. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. They care about your wellbeing. You’re encouraged to learn and educate yourself all the time.

Supporting your team matters. It makes an entire world of difference.
