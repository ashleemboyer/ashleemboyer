_Life is really hard sometimes. We're all going through something. You're not alone._

What you're doing is hard work. It's taking up a lot of your energy. You don't feel valued for all of your efforts. It's not fair, I know. But if you're reading this and strongly relate, chances are you can't stop just yet. It's just not the right time.

So, what now? You have to keep moving. Give it everything you've got. It's OK if that's not much. Do whatever it takes. We all have our days and need a moment. Some people need more moments than others.

If you're not connecting with this article in your life right now, make sure you let other people take their moments. We have no idea what other people are going through in their personal lives. Some people have it really bad. Don't anyone's life harder than it has to be.
