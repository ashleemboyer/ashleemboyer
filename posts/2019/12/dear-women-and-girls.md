Dear Women & Girls,

Take up space. You are smart and deserving. If a man or boy tries to make you feel otherwise, refer to this list of statements below. Thanks to [@necessaryaf](https://twitter.com/necessaryaf/status/1193608467904368642) on Twitter for this list.

1. You interrupted me, I’m not finished talking.
2. No.
3. That isn’t funny.
4. That isn’t appropriate.
5. I already know that.
6. That won’t be necessary.
7. Leave me alone.
8. You're making me uncomfortable.
9. Stop ignoring what I’m saying.
10. You owe me an apology.
11. You don't need to be that close to me.
12. If you insist on speaking to me in this manner, I’m going to ask you to leave/I will not continue this conversation with you.

We're socially trained to soften our language, but we can change that.

Signed,

A Tired Woman in Tech
