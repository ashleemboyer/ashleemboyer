Day 2 was pretty quiet and smooth, but still exciting. I had two on-boarding meetings and will have one or two per day through next week. These are chances to learn more about the start of the company, how things work, and the company's values. It's also a great chance to meet people from different teams, which is pretty cool! Everyone is incredibly friendly.

I tried another new (to me) food place! It's a cross between Qdoba and Chipotle. I'm really enjoying all the walking involved with working in the middle of a big city. Speaking of which: I purchased a monthly parking pass! The walk is twice as long as the one from today and yesterday, but that's what I was shooting for. With my bad back, walking is one of the only ways for me to start working out again. ðŸ˜Š

I'd say the only negative thing about the day was traffic on the way home. I've heard that while traffic in this state isn't nearly as bad as cities with higher populations, the people are excessively rude and full of road rage. I already knew it'd be like this, but it's still gross. I wish more people would just be kind and realize that everyone on the road has a story.

Stay tuned for day 3! I'll get to start looking at the code more closely, so things should get extra interesting. ðŸ˜€
