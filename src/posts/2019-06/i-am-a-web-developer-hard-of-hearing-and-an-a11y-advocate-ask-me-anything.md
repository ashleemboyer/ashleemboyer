Really, anything. I don't claim to be the spokesperson for all disabled people that need web accessibility, but I'm here to give you my own personal perspective.

Additionally, your questions don't even have to be about web development or a11y. If you have general questions about what it's like to be hard of hearing, please, ask away.

See you in the comments!
