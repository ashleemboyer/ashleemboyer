title: A Haiku About Pausing

Still feeling under the weather, but I mustered up the brain energy to write this little haiku:

“I’m not really sure
If it is against the rules
Blog challenge is paused”

Hopefully I’ll be back at it again tomorrow with some more exciting content, but no promises.

Until then, keep pushing! Unless you get sick, of course. :) Either way, you’ve got this.
