_I'm taking an hours-long final later, so today's post is going to be super simple._

What are your do's & don't's for getting started in teaching? I've enjoyed every opportunity to teach people about code or technology and want to do it more. Right now it's just a broad dream of mine, and it's hard to pare it down to take forward steps.

I'm open to all tips and stories here. Wherever you have taught, whatever age you have taught, I'd love to hear what you want to share.
