I came across an excellent tweet last night by Twitter user [Amycruz](https://twitter.com/AmarachiAmaechi):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To be a good developer you don’t have to spend 99% of your time writing, reading about coding. Do other activities. it helps to be more creative and to enrich your knowledge.<br><br>What other activities do you engage in aside coding 🤔🤔</p>&mdash; Amycruz 👩‍💻 👩‍💻 👩‍💻 (@AmarachiAmaechi) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmarachiAmaechi/status/1132018328988454912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is such a great point. I see many devs talking about how hard it is to cope with the insane amount of information online. On the one hand: _it feels a little bit competitive_. Who can learn the newest framework the fastest and build a super cool app and start making money? On the other hand: it's hard to choose which things to learn in what order because you're scared of falling behind.

Let's start by acknowledging we'll never learn everything. First of all, it's impossible. Second of all, it's not necessary. Learn the skills you need for the job you want. Then, you can fill in the gaps as needed. However, all of you learnaholics like myself might be wondering how to fit your extra learning into that mindset. The answer is balance.

You _must_ balance learning with other activities. Without balance, you risk burnout, as is the case with most things. So, find some hobbies! I personally enjoy knitting, crocheting, cross-stitching, and reading memoirs. Creative hobbies are very beneficial. You can meet new people who share the same hobby, have interesting things to talk about yourself in job interviews, and clear your mind for a while from stressful things.

Have any non-code hobbies you'd like to share? Drop a comment! :)
