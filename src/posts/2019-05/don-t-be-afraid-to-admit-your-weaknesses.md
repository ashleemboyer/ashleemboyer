Do you know what it means when you can admit your weaknesses? It means you've probably recognized the following:

1. You are less afraid to be wrong
2. You aren't perfect
3. You have things to work on
4. You are working on the things

Other people figure these things _about_ you when you openly admit your weaknesses. On Mother's Day, I was having dinner with my mom and grandma and we were talking about air fryers and cooking. _My grandma is an_ **_exceptional_** _cook so it's a common topic of discussion._

I haven't cooked in nearly 3 months because of my long commute, so they asked what I've been eating. I said something along the lines of, "Mostly microwave dinners, but I have a problem with impulsively buying fast-food during my drives." To that, my mom said, "You're openly admitting that???" And then my grandma swooped in with, "No, it's good she can admit it!"

I get that they are my family and the dynamic is different than that of one in the professional workplace, so I'll give you another example if you're still feeling skeptical.

A few years ago, I attended a weekend-long leadership workshop at my school. At one of the follow-up dinners, we went around the room and named something we wanted to spend 30 days improving. I named "road rage" because that's something I can be pretty bad about. The speaker was very surprised and we all laughed about it because it was relieving to hear such an honest answer.

People appreciate honesty and vulnerability. Good people will thank you for being open. It's how we relate.
