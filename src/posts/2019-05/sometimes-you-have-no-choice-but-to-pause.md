description: Listen to your body. Itâ€™s very honest about how itâ€™s feeling.

Iâ€™ve said this before, and Iâ€™ll say it forever: your health is more important than anything else. Take care of your body. Feed it good things. Rest it when it hurts. Youâ€™re not a bad person if you need a break or to step back from something. Sacrifice your well-being for no one.

_This post is short because_ I _need a break. Hope to be back tomorrow with our regularly-lengthed posts. ðŸ’•_
