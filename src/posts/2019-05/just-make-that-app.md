As someone who's new to the web dev game, I find it hard to accept all my ideas as good ones. Yes, you read that right, _all_ ideas are good ideas. Ideas are similar to questions, it's all about the timing. Every single idea you have leads to a learning experience.

There's a lot of pressure to make something _cool_ or _super useful_ and _profitable_. You don't have to do that right now, especially if you're learning a new framework. You can make any app you want to, for whatever reason you want to. If no one is getting hurt, just do it!

There are no dumb ideas. Some ideas are better than others obviously, but all ideas keep our creative juices flowing. Once you get started, it'll be hard to stop. Eventually, you'll find the best idea to suit your current situation. All you have to do is sit and listen to your thoughts without judgment. Let them all pour out freely.

Now, let's hear those app ideas! Maybe you'll find someone with a similar idea. Maybe get in touch and think about collabing. :)
