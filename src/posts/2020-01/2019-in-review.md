In April of 2019, I knew I needed to change my life. I was extremely unhappy in a toxic workplace, had no involvement in my community, and the only tech people I knew in my area worked at the same place and none of us talked to each other. I decided to [join Twitter to network](https://ashleemboyer.com/why-and-how-you-should-use-twitter-for-networking) and figure out what was going on in the tech world. (Side note: I've gained 1,800 followers since!)

Then, I discovered [DEV Community](https://dev.to). It seemed like a great place to start writing. I needed to do _something_ with all of the emotions I was feeling at the time. So, I wrote about my process for looking for a new job: [How to Identify Your Knowledge Gaps in Under an Hour](https://ashleemboyer.com/how-to-identify-your-knowledge-gaps-in-under-an-hour). It got 187 views, 8 reactions, and 1 comment.

I'd never gotten so many views on one post before! So, I decided to write another one the next day: [It's OK to be Scared](https://ashleemboyer.com/it-s-ok-to-be-scared) (204 views and 6 reactions). Then I wrote my first "hit" the following day: [Neither You nor Your Work Has to be Perfect](neither-you-nor-your-work-has-to-be-perfect) (1234 views, 82 reactions, 24 comments). I think that was my first post that DEV Community ([@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev)) tweeted out. It felt so validating having my post shared by an account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

I think it was at this time that I decided to do a 30-day blogging challenge. I've always loved to write, but never succeeded in making it a habit. My goal was to write regularly. This is something I'm still trying to figure out, and I think most other people are too. Life is unpredictable and very hard to plan for. Habits and hobbies are hard to keep up with.

So, I did my challenge, and I was hooked. Some posts did really well, some got less than 100 views. It helped me gauage what I really wanted to write about and what people liked reading about. If you want to read about the results of the challenge, I wrote about it: [After 30 Days of Writing on DEV.to](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer/after-30-days-of-writing-on-dev-to-a08).

The challenge did exactly what I wanted it to. I felt confident in what I had to say and decided to spend some time to work on my own blog site. I'd cross-post everything and keep track of stats with Google Analytics. I started recording stats on my personal site on August 11, 2019. I'll spend the rest of this post sharing some of those stats and also the ones I can get on DEV.

2019 was an excellent year for me both professionally and personally. I'm so glad I decided to make a change 9 months ago. Thank you all for hanging out with me and helping me make this a great year. Here's to 2020! ðŸŽ‰
