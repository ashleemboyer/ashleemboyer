Why, yes, I would love to be done with the set up of my sites so I could focus more on the side projects I want to post on my portfolio.

_Didn't you_ just _[post about perfectionism](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer/neither-you-nor-your-work-has-to-be-perfect-10p4) yesterday?_

Sure did! But this is different. Software will forever be a road with many twists, turns, and hills. üòâ

In all seriousness, I hadn't tried Gatsby out before publishing the current Angular version of my sites. I finally gave in over this past weekend and decided to give it a go. It was SO. FUN. **First of all**, their documentation is excellent. They explain things well enough that people with any level of coding experience can work out what to do.

**Second of all**, the framework is just incredibly easy to use. Make some files in a well-named directory, and you have some magical pages. You can make pages _dynamically_ too, which is one of the reasons I'm switching.

**Finally**, it's just too easy to do everything you want using their plugins. For example, with the [`gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet) plugin, you can handle SEO _and_ Open Graph metadata dynamically. Which means you can have cool Twitter cards with images when you share your posts in a tweet. Which blows my mind! _(Is this possible in Angular? Too late for me, but maybe someone else could use that knowledge.)_

And let's be honest, I just want to play around with Gatsby some more. You see a ton of people who use it for their blog sites, so I want to take that information and use it to challenge myself to make something that'll really stand out. üí™üèª

So, what about you? Do you use Gatsby for your sites, or do you plan to? I'd love to hear about your projects in the comments or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashleemboyer).
