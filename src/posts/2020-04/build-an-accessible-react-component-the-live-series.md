# Thank you!! üéâ

[Last Tuesday's stream](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer/live-tonight-build-a-react-firebase-blog-site-pp8) was fantastic! I now have two posts to add to my ["Build a React & Firebase Blog Site" Series](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer/build-a-react-firebase-blog-site-part-1-4gn0) and am considering packaging the series up in an ebook format!

# What's this about? ü§î

In the meantime, I've been thinking about topics for upcoming Tuesdays and have decided to make a whole series about building accessible React components. I have [an `a11y-components` repository](https://gitlab.com/ashleemboyer/a11y-components) with a couple of things in it already, but needed a break from all things outside of work for a while. What better way to pick things back up than with a live series to add to the repository?

# Neat! How's it going to work? ‚ú®

Here's the idea: we'll pick a random widget from the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices) with an on-screen wheel, then build it in React! If a really complex component is chosen, it might take an extra stream to finish it, but we'll walk through the whole thing from start to finish!

# Let's gooo! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

To get notified when I go live on stream, you can [follow me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ashleemboyer). If you can't catch the stream live, it'll still be available afterwards to re-watch! I also plan on uploading my videos to YouTube really soon since they don't stay on Twitch forever.
