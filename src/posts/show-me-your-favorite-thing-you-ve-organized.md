I love organizing things (when I'm not feeling overwhelmed by the number of things I need to do at my house ðŸ™ƒ). If you have something you've organized that you're super proud of, let's see it! Whether it's your closet, code project, toolbox, silverware drawer, browser bookmarks, whatever, ... I love seeing pictures of this kind of stuff. It's a good thing I don't use Instagram anymore. I could waste hours looking at home organization. ðŸ¥°
