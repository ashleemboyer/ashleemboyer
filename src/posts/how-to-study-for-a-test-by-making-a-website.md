With my crazy schedule of driving 1.5 hours one-way for a class four days a week, I haven't had as much time to write code outside of work. I also see tons of people on Twitter talking about React or Gatbsy, which makes me want to dig into them even more.

So, I'm making an informational website on Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics II to study _and_ practice my Gatsby skills. ðŸ˜‰ The course material is separated very nicely already: 7 advanced topics and 6 core topics. So far, there's one page for each which are linked from the home page with a little summary description.

On each page, I plan on showing a list at the top of the important terms and definitions the relevant textbook section and I'm also inserting the examples most helpful to me.

Finally, I'm also creating a glossary page where all of the important terms and definitions will be formally described and linked to from any of the other site pages.

I feel extremely nerdy for doing this and it's _actually_ incredibly fun. I'm trying to pick up on little things along the way too, such as practicing semantic HTML. I found this really cool post while looking up the differences between `<section>` and `<article>` elements.

I hope this post inspires you to do whatever it takes to accomplish your goals. Figure out what tactics work for you, and [just get it done](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer/just-do-the-thing-10el).
