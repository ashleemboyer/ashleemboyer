I'm finding myself busier than ever and would love to hear what tools you use to keep yourself organized. When I was in college, I used Google Calendar for project group meetings and a paper planner for keeping track of when assignments were due.

If you have any pictures to share of your setup, I'd love to see those too! It's intriguing how differently everyone does the same thing. ðŸ¤“
